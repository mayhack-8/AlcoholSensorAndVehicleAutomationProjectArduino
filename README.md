Alcohol Sensor & Vehicle Automation System
This Arduino project integrates an MQ-3 alcohol sensor to enhance vehicle safety. It detects alcohol levels from the driver's breath and prevents vehicle ignition if alcohol is detected. The system also checks seatbelt status and ensures the vehicle starts only when safety conditions are met.
ðŸš— Features
Alcohol Detection using MQ-3 sensor
Ignition Control â€” disables ignition if alcohol is detected
Seatbelt Check â€” ensures the seatbelt is fastened before starting
Buzzer Alerts for unsafe conditions
Relay-based engine simulation
